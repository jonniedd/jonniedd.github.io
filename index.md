<!--You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jonniedd/jonniedd.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.--->

## Main Project: Health, Care, and Beyond (Health Marketplace)

**Front-end:** Diya, Jon

The idea for this project was a website similar to how Amazon functions; rather than an open market, our website would be specialized towards healthcare products such as medication, supplements, etc.

## Side Project: Self-Affirmed Refactoring Research Website (Professor's research website)
